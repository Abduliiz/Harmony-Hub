## The Purpose of My Project

</span>


1. **What will the application do?**
2. **Who will use it?**
3. **Why is this project of interest to you?**



I have decided to create a music player application that can play music and read *MP3 files*.
This application can be used by anybody that loves music or has *MP3 files* like voice recordings or any other audio files that have the *MP3 format*. 
I am really interested in this project because i use a music player daily in my life and i think it would be really cool to create my own to show my friends and family.
